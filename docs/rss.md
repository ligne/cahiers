## Apps

A comparison of three reader apps (Feedly, NewsBlur, Inoreader) from [Zapier](https://zapier.com/blog/best-rss-feed-reader-apps/).
There's not much in it, to be honest: all of them provide a web interface and a reasonable-looking Android app that works offline, with a freemium model.

I feel [disinclined to support Feedly](https://www.citationneeded.news/feedly-launches-strikebreaking-as/).

The NewsBlur Android app is rather pleasant and ergonomic.
I can't get used to the webapp: it binds down-arrow to Next Story, so I keep finding myself on a different article whenever I try to scroll down.
This is the service Cory Doctorow says he uses in his [panegyric to RSS feeds](https://doctorow.medium.com/you-should-be-using-an-rss-reader-76aed31151f9).

The main limitations of the free tier are:

- A limited number of subscriptions.
    I'm not there yet but I think I'm getting close?
- No unified feed.
    The feeds list can be filtered to only show those with unread articles, so this just means a bit more clicking.
- Auto-expiry of unread articles after 2 weeks.
    I've not found this too much of an issue so far, not least because you can save stories for later.
    Expired stories are still available; you just can't mark them as unread.

These last two can make it hard to focus on just articles that are about to expire, however.

Saved stories are easy to browse, and are also useful for switching to a more comfortable device or deferring to a more convenient time.

But ultimately the choice doesn't matter all that much as long as it provides [OPML export](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPML).

There are also self-hosted options like [FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org/index.html).
