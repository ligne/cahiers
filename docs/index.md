# Introduction

I'm one of those people who always has hundreds of open tabs across a dozen windows of multiple browsers.
Partly this is because I'm bad at tidying them up when I'm done,
but for the most part it's because they contain something that is useful (or that I feel *might* be useful),
just not quite yet.

I'm hoping that by writing them down here, I will be able to find them later when I actually need them.
